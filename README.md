# Simple Text Editor Using Ropes Data Structure
 This is the final project for the course Data Structures II - CS 201, offered in Spring 2023 by Habib University. It is a simple Text Editor created from scratch using Python and Tkinter implemented on Ropes Data Structure. 

## About Ropes
A Rope data structure is a tree data structure which is used to store or manipulate large strings in a more efficient manner. It allows for operations like insertion, deletion, search and random access to be executed faster and much more efficiently in comparison to a traditional String.

This data structure is widely used by softwares such as text editors like Sublime, email systems like Gmail and text buffers to handle large strings efficiently.
